START_POSITION is an INTEGER telling MID at which character position in SOURCE_STRING to start. The first character of SOURCE_STRING is considered 1. GATHER_LENGTH is an INTEGER telling MID how many characters to use from SOURCE_STRING. RETURN_VALUE: A STRING GATHER_LENGTH characters long starting st START_POSITION. If START_POSITION is greater than the length of SOURCE_STRING, an empty STRING is returned. If GATHER_LENGTH is greater than the total number of characters that can be retrieved starting from START_POSITION, only the remaining characters in SOURCE_STRING will be pulled. For Example, MID(\"ABCD\", 2, 10) would return a STRING containing BCD."
